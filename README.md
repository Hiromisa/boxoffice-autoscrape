# Box Office auto scraper + change alerts

Using GitHub Actions and Python, this repo automatically scrapes the content of the BoxOfficemojo's Weeklly statistics webpage every four hours, 
and sends the content to me as an attachment in my email if it has been changed. (ex: new weekly data added, old data modified or just something changed). 
You can check the latest csv file [here](https://github.com/Hiromisa/boxofficescrape/blob/main/WeeklyBoxoffice.csv).
